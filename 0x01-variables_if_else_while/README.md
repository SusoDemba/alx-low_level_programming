# C - Variables, if, else, while project
	* 0-positive_or_negative.c - assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
	variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program. if the number is greater than 0,
	print a message that shows is positive,
	if the number is 0: is zero, and if the number is less than 0: is negative. Followed by a new line.
	* 1-last_digit.c -  assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
	If the last digit of n is greater than 5: display a message that shows that it's grater than 5,
	else if last digit of n is 0, display message for that
	Otherwise if the last digit is less than 6 but not  0, it displays a message confirming that.
	* 2-print_alphabet.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
	* 3-print_alphabets.c - displays the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
	* 4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
	* 5-print_numbers.c - displays all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
	* 6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
	* 7-print_tebahpla.c - displays the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line
	* 8-print_base16.c - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line
